## Welcome to The Hunger Games

Choose a character and see if you can defend any of the other remaining characters.

If you can defend all the characters then you will win the game.

If not, try again by clicking on the Restart Button. 

## Strategy

1. I had to retrieve the images for each player. 
2. I created an array of objects, each object represented the information about a player. 
3. Then I created the logic to choose the 'My Character' and move the remaining characters to a specific area of the page. 
4. Once I had #3 working, I then created the logic to choose the 'My Defender', again moving the remaining characters to a specific area of the page. 
5. Then I worked on the logic to add and remove the health points. 
6. I had to write the logic to handle the use case when the My Character wins or losses. 
7. I cleaned up the code by identifying areas where I could take repeating code and create a function, that can be used repeatedly.
